# 1. Streamlit

# Purpose: Streamlit is a Python framework for building interactive web apps for data science and machine learning with very little code.

# Functions:

# Turns Python scripts into interactive dashboards.

# Provides widgets like sliders, buttons, checkboxes, and file uploaders.

# Used to deploy ML models or data visualization apps quickly.

# Example use: Show model predictions on a webpage, visualize graphs interactively.

# 2. OpenCV (opencv-python)

# Purpose: OpenCV is a computer vision library used for processing and analyzing images and videos.

# Functions:

# Reading, displaying, and writing images/videos.

# Image transformations (resize, crop, rotate, flip).

# Edge detection, contour detection, blurring, filtering.

# Face detection, object tracking, motion analysis.

# Example use: Capturing real-time video from a webcam and detecting faces.

# 3. TensorFlow

# Purpose: TensorFlow is a machine learning and deep learning framework developed by Google.

# Functions:

# Build and train neural networks.

# Support for CPU and GPU acceleration.

# Handles large-scale numerical computation.

# Provides pre-trained models (e.g., image classification, NLP).

# Example use: Training an AI to classify images of cats vs dogs.

# 4. Keras

# Purpose: Keras is a high-level API that runs on top of TensorFlow (sometimes Theano or CNTK earlier).

# Functions:

# Makes building deep learning models simpler.

# Provides easy-to-use layers, models, optimizers, and losses.

# Abstracts complex TensorFlow code into simpler syntax.

# Example use: Define a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with just a few lines.

# 5. NumPy

# Purpose: NumPy is the fundamental library for numerical computation in Python.

# Functions:

# Handles multi-dimensional arrays (ndarrays).

# Fast mathematical operations (linear algebra, Fourier transforms).

# Provides random number generation and matrix manipulation.

# Example use: Represent an image as a pixel array, perform matrix multiplications in neural networks.

# 6. Pillow (PIL)

# Purpose: Pillow is a Python library for image processing and manipulation.

# Functions:

# Open, save, and convert images in different formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).

# Resize, crop, rotate, blur, and enhance images.

# Add text, filters, and effects.

# Example use: Preprocess dataset images before feeding into an ML model.
